# LM-feature-visualization
This is an (incomplete) copy of some work in progress code for my upcoming paper with Joshua Clymer. 

The main notebook to run is visualization_demo.ipynb

Note that I've removed model checkpoints from this repo as they are too large, so the code will not work unless you get the checkpoints from https://github.com/ChunyuanLI/Optimus/blob/master/doc/optimus_finetune_language_models.md
